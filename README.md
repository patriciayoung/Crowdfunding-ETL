Jupyter Notebook is in Starter_Files and Resources, CSV files are in there are well.

ETL Project Debrief Questions:
What are the challenges associated with ETL? 
A common problem ran into was to make sure the data was all formatted congruently. 
Another hiccup we ran into was keeping in line where the appropriate data was pulled from, as well as writing the necessary code to form the data frames.
Loading the CSV files and making sure that we created the column correctly to hold all the data especially extra long inputs.


What are the benefits of ETL?
With going through the process of ETL, this allowed us to format the data in a consistent, easy to read way. ELT allows for more collaborative work from multiple sources. After completing the process the data is more accessible to non-computer experts unlike KJ's and Jacob's students. 

How might ETL change when moving to the cloud?
Moving ETL to the cloud allow integration with other cloud services. Some other benefits could include flexibility, scalability, and stream line the process. 
Some concerns moving to the cloud could be security and cost. (We are not cloud experts, these are guesses.)
